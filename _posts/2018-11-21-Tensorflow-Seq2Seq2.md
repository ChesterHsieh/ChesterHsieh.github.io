## Introduction
This post is series of Tensorflow exploring. It's personal study note. I assume reader should have basic idea about how deep learning works. 


## Embedded
#### embedding_lookup

## LSTMCell


## Some nn 




## Key knowledge
 - stepwise_cross_entropy
 - AdamOptimizer


## Reference
