# Motivation
How many design patterns? I guess there's limited number for that? Once you DS "How many different categories of ML question?" The number is very shocking. 24 or More.

Another issue which talked from other posts is  overdesign. 
1. Can I find out 3 different design patterns are more useful in ML application? 
2. When should we start to think of design patterns?
3. I can apply the the pesudo project for the exist desgin pattern.
