- 2015 DL review
- _Rebooting AI_

# RL area
Beginner friendly: OpenAir 
# NLP
2017, 2018,2019 is the transformer winning years
-Megatron LM from nvidia
-XLnet: Mutation of bert: outperform the vanilla bert
-ALBERT light way bert
## ACL winner: Multiple domains dialogue

3. Pay right attentions on important part
4. Create opinion
5. ML
6. Make fun but correction. Informative data isn't the primary goal here. 

## Code2Seq

# RL
## Multiagent-learning
## Imperfect information game

# Science of Deep Learning
- lottery hypothesis of DL: very small piece of network can replace whole networks. 
- graphic deep learning.
