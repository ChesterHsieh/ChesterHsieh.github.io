## Behavior Questions - 14 Principle
1. Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backward. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.


2. Ownership
主人翁(不为短期业绩牺牲长期价值,绝不会说不是我的工作)
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”
------
Give me a example of when you took a risk and it failed?

3. Invent and Simplify
创新简化(使工作简化,开展新业务时,接受被长期误解的可能)
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here”. Because we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
------
Tell me a time when you created an innovative product?


4.  Are Right, A Lot
决策正确(寻求多样的视角,挑战自己的观念)
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgement and good instincts.  They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
--------
Tell me about a time when you observed two business opportunities to improve ROI, and how did you determine that they were connected?


5. Learn and Be Curious
好奇求知(不停止学习,对各种可能性充满好奇并加以行动)
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

6. Hire and Develop the Best
选贤任能(从员工角度出发,创建职业发展机制)
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognise people with exceptional talent and will move them throughout the organisation. Leaders develop leaders and are serious about their role in coaching others.  We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

7. Insist on the Highest Standards
最高标准(确保问题不会蔓延,解决问题,不再出现)
Leaders have relentlessly high standards – many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
8. Think Big
远见卓识(大局策略,不同角度看问题,寻找如何服务客户)
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

9. Bias for Action
崇尚行动(速度,深思熟虑下进行冒险)
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

The risk is a reputation for the company.  However, it might be a new blue ocean for company. 

10. Frugality
勤俭节约(更少投入更大产出)
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention.  There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.
----
Tell me about a time where you thought of a clever new way to save money for the company. 同樣for most challenge project !

11. Earn Trust
赢得信任(专注倾听,坦诚沟通,尊重他人,自我批评)
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing.  Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odour smells of perfume.  They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
----
Tell me a time when you earned trust of a group.
How's 
I believe to make mistake and honest to knowledge is key to becoming better. In the beginning, the team leader didn't trust me on dealing the problem. I'm one say I don't know for 50% time. After days co-work, they know how I'm working on.

12. Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.
---
Tell me about a time when you had to dive deep into the data and the results you achieved.
I love mathmatics.



13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
敢于谏言,服从大局(质疑无法苟同的决策,不为一团和气妥协,一旦决定,全身心实现目标)
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
----

14. Deliver Results
达成业绩(从不气馁,勇于挑战,及时完成工作)
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never compromise.

## Behavior Questions - Very General One


#### Why Amazon?
	Amazon is a top internet retailing company with a strong focus on customer experience and obsession. Its motto- work hard, have fun, make history, and it’s vision, earth’s most customer centric company, inspires me. I’m a person who respect hard working and care a lot about customer experience, so the culture of Amazon attracts me a lot. Furthermore, the growth of this company is pretty impressive, it’s not only an online retail shop but also has a wide range of products like Alexa, Kindle, fire tablet and TV, Amazon cloud service, etc. Hundreds of thousands of talented engineers are working passionately here, building innovative system and solving problems at unprecedented scale. Therefore, this is a place where I can learn a lot, and use my skills and experience to make things happen with a team. 

#### Why choose this position?
	The job I have applied is the software development position in Amazon Books, I am interested in this position because:  . From 1point 3acres bbs
	First of all, Amazon Books uses innovative technology to merge physical and online worlds into one unique and delightful shopping experience. The concept is really cool and pioneering. I am really excited about learning and using new technologies to create new exceptional experiences that firmly obsess customers.
	Secondly, I’d like to work with solutions from a full-stack point of view, by engaging with requirements, frontend, middle tier, backend, storage, and all the other stuff, I can understand problems and solutions thoroughly, and thus scale and optimize them with the best practices. 
	Thirdly, I’m happy to work in an environment with a lot of challenges so that I’ll never be boring. In Amazon, I can take ownership of the projects I am truly passionate about. I am sure I can take the challenges and provide successful solutions. 

#### Most challenging project?
The most challenging project I’ve done was an online collaborative coding platform, it’s like Leetcode but with collaborative feature. The most challenging part was to incorporate collaborative features with the code editor, that is, user in a same coding room can see the real-time cursor movements and typing actions of the other users.
It was challenging because I was supposed to come up with the solution and implement it by myself, and I have never developed something like this before.
So I started with composing a visual solution first, the work I’ve done included researching online collaborative products, listing core features I needed, building wireframes, and designing UI. With the visual solution, I had a good understanding on how the application would work. Then, I googled and read a lot of system design solutions for products with similar features, like Google doc, online chatting room, etc. With what I’ve read, I was able to draft out my own solutions and selected corresponding technologies.
I implemented it successfully within the given time, and my solution received a positive feedback because it is not only working well, but also visually pleasing. Throughout this process, I learned that it is important to be curious and keep learning, try to read as many technical blogs or articles as you can, the more you read, the better you’ll ace a problem or design. The feeling of ownership is very important, some other students just gave up with the excuse “I don’t how to do it". visit 1point3acres for more.

#### Doxygen Story(deep dive, bias for action, backbone, ownership)
Study Nordic source code. We need the document tool.  Doxygen is a good idea. While I told my boos, she thought we had really tie schedule that time. Not only I need to know how to use the tool but also for everyone on the team needs to know how it worked. I agreed with my boss. We must give the products on time. However, I believe for long-term coding quality, a proper document is necessary for the team. I decided to spend my leisure time on this. I believe it could benefit after that. While I gave first try and understand how it worked. I build a lecture and record. I showed the result to the boss. She's really impressive. In the monthly meeting, my boss assigned every member on the team need to watch the video.  Asked them to need to finish in a month. Since that time, I know if the cost not too much. Take action and prototype is most convincible.

#### The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it?  (1,11,14).
    The biggest mistake I’ve made happened when I took on and led a project for the first time. I got a requirement from the client about updating parts of a certain product. I need to give the prospect schedule.

    I diagnosed the client requirement immediately, we only need to change the protocol from Bluetooth into RF protocol. Actually, the task was using a simple system to replace the complicated one. There's a mistake here. I expected to finish it within 2 weeks. However, it didn't go as I expected. I forgot to consider the hardware problem.

    I apologized to the client immediately and asked if we could have an extended delivery date. Luckily the client agreed and also showed understanding. Then I called a meeting with all the team members, talked about the feedback, then we walked through the whole workflow step by step together, evaluated all the component. Throughout this process, the team members understood what happened. Instead of just telling the client to postpone the schedule. I continue to communicate for all situation again, I earned their trust by sharing the feedback with them and working out a solution together.
