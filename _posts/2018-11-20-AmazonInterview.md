# Leaderships
# 1. Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backward. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

## who was your most diffcult customer?
    The biggest mistake I’ve made happened when I took on and led a project for the first time. I got a requirement from the client about updating parts of a certain product. I need to give the prospect schedule.

    I diagnosed the client requirement immediately, we only need to change the protocol from Bluetooth into RF protocol. Actually, the task was using a simple system to replace the complicated one. There's a mistake here. I expected to finish it within 2 weeks. However, it didn't go as I expected. I forgot to consider the hardware problem.

   Throughout this process, the team members understood what happened. Instead of just telling the client to postpone the schedule. I continue to communicate for all situation again, I earned their trust by sharing the feedback with them and working out a solution together.

# 2. Ownership
主人翁(不为短期业绩牺牲长期价值,绝不会说不是我的工作)
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”

## Give me a example of when you took a risk and it failed?
S: Cloud computing, off is off. I leave the machine to run
T: To get it done on time
A: Learn something, 
R: Find out the problem right on the time. and did it better.

## Give an example of when you saw a peer struggling and decided to step in and help. 
S:
T:
A:
R: Investment is very long-term. To build up the trust is neceesary for everyone.

# 3. Invent and Simplify
创新简化(使工作简化,开展新业务时,接受被长期误解的可能)
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here”. Because we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
## Tell me a time when you created an innovative product?
S: Old product is gym smart band. New customer ask from equipment supplier
T: Get the work done in short time with variery differnt compound movement
A: Instead of wear on the user. We directly the put on weight. AS  a linear move
R: We can generize all the product into differnt function equipment

# 4.  Are Right, A Lot
决策正确(寻求多样的视角,挑战自己的观念)
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgement and good instincts.  They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
## Tell me about a time when you were wrong?
Situation: Gym tracker,

Result:
	Don't try to use latest tool all the time, It doen't mean we should stop to learn, but it's always import to evaluate . Two woodcutters story isn't always correct on favor one strategy. 


# 5. Learn and Be Curious
好奇求知(不停止学习,对各种可能性充满好奇并加以行动)
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

# 6. Hire and Develop the Best
选贤任能(从员工角度出发,创建职业发展机制)
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognise people with exceptional talent and will move them throughout the organisation. Leaders develop leaders and are serious about their role in coaching others.  We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

# 7. Insist on the Highest Standards
最高标准(确保问题不会蔓延,解决问题,不再出现)
Leaders have relentlessly high standards – many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.


# 8. Think Big
远见卓识(大局策略,不同角度看问题,寻找如何服务客户)
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
## Story:

# 9. Bias for Action
崇尚行动(速度,深思熟虑下进行冒险)
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

## Question
- Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?
## Story: Doxygen
Situation: Busy working time. One of biggest bluetooth sample code
Task: Delivery proper format and automatically matain document.
Actioin: Take extra time after work. To prepare all the tutorial material. And give the esay sample to approve value and ask for extra resouce(other's employee's time). Host a meeting
Resut: I got meaninful bounous 1 dollar. 
New cooperation Story: When I was working in JMEX. I need to play the role of demonstrating the products.  Some opportunity comes. Gym Tracker
The risk is a reputation for the company.  However, it might be a new blue ocean for company. 


# 10. Frugality

# 11. Earn Trust
赢得信任(专注倾听,坦诚沟通,尊重他人,自我批评)
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing.  Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odour smells of perfume.  They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

# Behavior Questions - Very General One
## Why Amazon?
	Amazon is a top internet retailing company with a strong focus on customer experience and obsession. Its motto- work hard, have fun, make history, and it’s vision, earth’s most customer centric company, inspires me. I’m a person who respect hard working and care a lot about customer experience, so the culture of Amazon attracts me a lot. Furthermore, the growth of this company is pretty impressive, it’s not only an online retail shop but also has a wide range of products like Alexa, Kindle, fire tablet and TV, Amazon cloud service, etc. Hundreds of thousands of talented engineers are working passionately here, building innovative system and solving problems at unprecedented scale. Therefore, this is a place where I can learn a lot, and use my skills and experience to make things happen with a team. 

## Why choose this position?
	The job I have applied is the software development position in Amazon Books, I am interested in this position because:  . From 1point 3acres bbs
	First of all, Amazon Books uses innovative technology to merge physical and online worlds into one unique and delightful shopping experience. The concept is really cool and pioneering. I am really excited about learning and using new technologies to create new exceptional experiences that firmly obsess customers.
	Secondly, I’d like to work with solutions from a full-stack point of view, by engaging with requirements, frontend, middle tier, backend, storage, and all the other stuff, I can understand problems and solutions thoroughly, and thus scale and optimize them with the best practices. 
	Thirdly, I’m happy to work in an environment with a lot of challenges so that I’ll never be boring. In Amazon, I can take ownership of the projects I am truly passionate about. I am sure I can take the challenges and provide successful solutions. 

## Doxygen Story(deep dive, bias for action, backbone, ownership)
Study Nordic source code. We need the document tool.  Doxygen is a good idea. While I told my boos, she thought we had really tie schedule that time. Not only I need to know how to use the tool but also for everyone on the team needs to know how it worked. I agreed with my boss. We must give the products on time. However, I believe for long-term coding quality, a proper document is necessary for the team. I decided to spend my leisure time on this. I believe it could benefit after that. While I gave first try and understand how it worked. I build a lecture and record. I showed the result to the boss. She's really impressive. In the monthly meeting, my boss assigned every member on the team need to watch the video.  Asked them to need to finish in a month. Since that time, I know if the cost not too much. Take action and prototype is most convincible.


# Possible Questions
1. Most diffcult challenge, what you learn form it
2. Most complicated
3. Convince someone
4. Don't know what to do, 
5. disagreement with manager/ Convince 
6. Give me example, influence to other ppl => Linear programming
7. Tell me a time when someone convince you
8.  How do you keep yourself motivated

# Case Study prep

# Distributed Training
- *Data parallelism:* Data is distributed across multiple machines. This can be used in case data is too large to be stored on a single machine or to achieve faster training.
- *Model parallelism*: Out of core issue on model might casue the proble. Distributed training is not going to make the training process faster, is to make it possible to traing bigger model. Concate differet computer to compute the result. 
## Type of NN
- CNN ; Each frame can be seen as sigle calculation. If the mu
- Fully Connected Layer. Can't do it with multiple cores.
	
## Parallel SGD
Key is asynchronous update on one node. We need have Parameter Server"BOSS", and workder 1, workder 2... etc.
Workers are assigned to compute the grad with same parameters. Boss will collect all the grad and update Parameter and send back to every workers.
