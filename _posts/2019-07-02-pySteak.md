# Intro
When everytime somebody ask me how to learn NLP/MLo r ask me about material, I can't give a proper answer. I learnt those by doing the project. In the beginning, there's always an idea walking ahead my knowledge. After ton of googling and stackoverflow, I can pick up some knowledge and able to decide which class I should pay time and $

This project is to prove and record How I do it. I want to learn computer vision and without any class experience. To see how far I can go.
