# [Notes on Noise Contrastive Estimation and Negative Sampling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.8251.pdf_)

It's kind of wired to write down note for note. In turn this isn't the typical NLP paper. 

 ## Improvement
 Cost on softmax is huge when training the word2vec model.  That's inherietence problem with multiple class proble. Intuitive requirement for the loss function in multi-class problem is entropy for the probability. 

***Reduce computing cost***
