## Begining

That's everything in the beginning. To get the data set and prepare them on the server.

Here's one idea I want to try. 

To build a restful API to suggest the Emoji.

Hmm............... It doesn't sounds cool. Since the Coursera course has same idea for model. I will try to go farther. 

However I need to scrape the data first.

## Every Piece we Nedd
1. Stable Scraper
2. AWS for hosting scraper
3. Database


### Stable Scraper
Here's the problem. 

I know there's wonderful and complicated framework for Scraper. => [Scpay]((https://scrapy.org/))
I think we might not need this time for such a simple purpose.



## Scrapy
Why **Scrapy**? Not just** beautiful soup **?
