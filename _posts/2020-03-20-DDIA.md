# CH 1
- Reliability
It's a topic about failurs and faults. 
	- function is correct
	- making mistake
	- loading/volume can handle the required
fault ~= failure
fault rely on error handling 
Hardware faults-> Redundancy. AWS is fairly common fail without message.....  SW fault-tolerance is more important in this situation
- Scalability
Define the Load. => Twitter Example
	- Post tweet: 4.6k requests/sec avg, 12k requests/sec peak
	- Home timeline: view posts they followe 300k requests/sec
1) Direct to read the database
2) Design a system can utilize the writting time(post tweet) to reduce the reading time(Home timeline update).
