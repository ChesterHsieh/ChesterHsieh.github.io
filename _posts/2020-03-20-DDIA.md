# CH 1
- Reliability
It's a topic about failurs and faults. 
	- function is correct
	- making mistake
	- loading/volume can handle the required
fault ~= failure
fault rely on error handling 
Hardware faults-> Redundancy. AWS is fairly common fail without message.....  SW fault-tolerance is more important in this situation
- Scalability
	- Define the Load. => Twitter Example
		- Post tweet: 4.6k requests/sec avg, 12k requests/sec peak
		- Home timeline: view posts they followe 300k requests/sec
		1) Direct to read the database
		2) Design a system can utilize the writting time(post tweet) to reduce the reading time(Home timeline update). 
	Hypbird solution in CH 12
	- Perfomance
		- Latency: internal perpective of delay. Latancy is the duration that request is waiting to be handled
		- response time: it's user-view on the delay. It includs queueing delay/network delay/...etc Therefore, we tend to think of **response time** as distribution instead of single solid number.

scaling up = vertical scaling
scaling out = horizontal scaling

- Maintainability
