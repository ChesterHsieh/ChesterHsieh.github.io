# Where I start
I want to share the experience about how I prepare data scientist. Here's my background. All I want you know is **I'm normal and not lucky guy**. I work in school as Research assistance for 6 months and applied 1300 different positions. If I restart it again, I might need shorter time to get the offer.

 - 3 Years firmware developing( coding c for microchip)
 - NLP research experience with no paper publication
 - Top 100 CS school
 - 3.6 GPA 
 - International student. No GC, No family in U.S.
 
 It's  easy to have better starting situation than my case,  so don't worry.
 
# Preparation


## Check LIST
The basic preparation you should finish to gain the basic knowledge to overcome interview. Be prepare for those steps. 
- Leetcode 
- Sklearn API
-  The questions in this blog :P
	- [A/B Test](https://chesterhsieh.github.io/2018/11/09/ABTest/)
	- [Data science real problem](https://chesterhsieh.github.io/2018/11/20/DS-Question-Collection/)
	- [NLP specfic problem](https://chesterhsieh.github.io/2018/12/02/2018-11-19-NLP_InterViewQuestion/)
- Deep learning
## Leetcode
In the beginning I don't believe this is necessary for DS, till I failed at least 5 different interviews. The reason why company want to do the code challenge for DS position is to prevent fake profile. There are many institution have expert to train the  candidates on **pretending to be senior developer**.  Coding challenge is a efficient way to get rid of fake expert. 

Our goal is clear. Don't put too much time on practicing this, however, we can still show the ability on coding.

Where to find the tag](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y6szAzphgYGRKO2IETGBPvbP3-uWLplJZSQJEG1rxG31aFqDQq08_LYp8Xy2HTFXudayu2Gqaqhu "Tag")

Pick the tag for one company. I chose facebook as my target. Any company is fine but FB has proper number questions and cover most of data structures. 200 questions isn't something big number to finish.

Try to eliminate the questions by data structure instead by difficulty. It will help you build the feeling to guess possible solution for the question. In my experience when you finish 3~5 questions in one data structure you will know how to build the basement to solve the problem. 

How to solve problem in proper way? I have a study group. We all face the situation is that sometime we'll get stuck by one question for hours. 

**Should I check solution before I actual pass some test case?**

I think is **NO**, Especially when you start doing another type of questions. Always set a timer, likes 20 minutes. If you don't have any idea to start, don't hesitate to check the discussion and solution. There's another problem will come out.

** Are you really really understand ?**

It's too easy to fool yourself. There is only a fine line between a understand and copy. Do it again next day is the best way to challenge yourself.

## Sklearn document
Here we are. The specific knowledge for data scientist. I don't how's structure for Machine learning course of other school. It's hard to follow step by step review list for the lecture. 

Sklearn is perfect tool and list let you go through most of ML algorithm. I believe there's more algorithm, however, to know the common ML algorithm is essential.

Here's screenshot for partial API document. Most of function I believe a qualified data scientist should know most of that. 

It's Very important to know more than school. That's the reason I failed many times. Remember one thing: **Every parameter is trying to solve some problems**. I take logistic regression as an example, **class_weight** is one way to solve unbalanced data. I never heard about that in Machine learning class. There's never wonderful data sets in real problem.  

## Deep learning
The quickest way 

## DS question
I spend ton of times to crack the DS questions. It's series trial and errors. However it turn out few scenario on designing question.

# How to apply job
## Resume 
There's very very common issue is that  **Do I have perfect resume?**. I don't think there's one legendary principle can help us build perfect resume. Just like we don't think there's perfect girl(boy) in the world. It vary by company system. However we are data scientist, we can design the A/B test scenario

## Networking v.s. Apply as much as you can

We all know networking is very important.

# Interview 
There's are few general type interview.
1. Phone interview
2. Online assessment
3. Machine learning case study
4. On-site( I can't tell, since I haven't being the on-site).
