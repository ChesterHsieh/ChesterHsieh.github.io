# Where I start
I want to share the experience about how I prepare data scientist. Here's my background. All I want you know is **I'm normal and not lucky guy**. I work in school as Research assistance for 6 months and applied 1300 different positions. If I restart it again, I might need shorter time to get the offer.

 - 3 Years firmware developing( coding c for microchip)
 - NLP research experience with no paper publication
 - Top 100 CS school
 - 3.6 GPA 
 - International student. No GC, No family in U.S.
 
 It's super easy to have better starting situation than my case.
