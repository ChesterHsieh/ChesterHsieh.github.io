#### General Preprocessing Process?

1.  Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka
2.  Text Cleaning is Task Specific
3.  Manual Tokenization
4.  Tokenization and Cleaning with NLTK
5.  Additional Text Cleaning Considerations
6.  Tips for Cleaning Text for Word Embedding

#### What is part of speech (POS) tagging? What is the simplest approach to building a POS tagger that you can imagine?

Is one of the main components of almost any NLP analysis. The task of POS-tagging simply implies labelling words with their appropriate Part-Of-Speech (Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Pronoun, …).

It following another question. Why we need to get part of speech?
Here's is really common and popular application rely on NLP.
->**Chatbot**

#### How would you build a POS tagger from scratch given a corpus of annotated sentences? How would you deal with unknown words?
1. [Tnt Tagger](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~thorsten/tnt/)

3. Consider the following analysis involving  woman  (a noun),  bought  (a verb),  over  (a preposition), and  the  (a determiner). The  text.similar()  method takes a word  w, finds all contexts  w1w  w2, then finds all words  w'  that appear in the same context, i.e.  w1w'w2.
If we have big enough corpus we can find enough past date support our analysis.

####  How would you train a model that identifies whether the word “Apple” in a sentence belongs to the fruit or the company?

Identify name entity is import part of building chatbot. POS is priori step for doing that.

#### How would you find all the occurrences of quoted text in a news article?
#### How would you build a system that auto corrects text that has been generated by a speech recognition system?

Here's the one big problem we having standard solution today. [Language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model) is one of solution. There's are different between common language model. We need to generate [character-level language model](https://towardsdatascience.com/language-models-spellchecking-and-autocorrection-dd10f739443c)

#### What is latent semantic indexing and where can it be applied?
#### What are stop words? Describe an application in which stop words should be removed.
#### How would you design a model to predict whether a movie review was positive or negative?

#### How to implement flexible text matching
 1. Soundex 
 2. Metaphone
 3. Edit Distance
