## Question Collection 


#### General Preprocessing Process?

1.  Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka
2.  Text Cleaning is Task Specific
3.  Manual Tokenization
4.  Tokenization and Cleaning with NLTK
5.  Additional Text Cleaning Considerations
6.  Tips for Cleaning Text for Word Embedding

#### What is part of speech (POS) tagging? What is the simplest approach to building a POS tagger that you can imagine?

Is one of the main components of almost any NLP analysis. The task of POS-tagging simply implies labelling words with their appropriate Part-Of-Speech (Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Pronoun, …).

It following another question. Why we need to get part of speech?
Here's is really common and popular application rely on NLP.

#### How would you build a POS tagger from scratch given a corpus of annotated sentences? How would you deal with unknown words?
1. [Tnt Tagger](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~thorsten/tnt/)

2. Consider the following analysis involving  woman  (a noun),  bought  (a verb),  over  (a preposition), and  the  (a determiner). The  text.similar()  method takes a word  w, finds all contexts  w1w  w2, then finds all words  w'  that appear in the same context, i.e.  w1w'w2.
If we have big enough corpus we can find enough past date support our analysis.

Here's also a very interesting instruction about building Pos tagger.[# A Good Part-of-Speech Tagger in about 200 Lines of Python](

####  How would you train a model that identifies whether the word “Apple” in a sentence belongs to the fruit or the company?
We can apply HMM model to identify the result. Most easy way to implement this is doing n-gram encoding then train the classification model.

#### How would you find all the occurrences of quoted text in a news article?
a hand-crafted extractor may not be such a bad thing, especially if you need to implement it quickly. Another option to use some existing rule-processing engine.

#### How would you build a system that auto corrects text that has been generated by a speech recognition system?

Here's the one big problem we having standard solution today. [Language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model) is one of solution. There's are different between common language model. We need to generate [character-level language model](https://towardsdatascience.com/language-models-spellchecking-and-autocorrection-dd10f739443c)

#### What is latent semantic indexing and where can it be applied?
Wait to answer :P

#### What are stop words? Describe an application in which stop words should be removed.
Wait to answer :P
#### How would you design a model to predict whether a movie review was positive or negative?

#### How to implement flexible text matching

 2. Metaphone
 3. Edit Distance


## Knowledge supplement :)
While I collect questions and try answer them, I review some key tool. I hope they'll also helpful for reader. 

#### [HMM & POS](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/iit-cs585/main/blob/master/lec/l07/L07.ipynb)
The main idea of Hidden Markov models

The output at time  ii  depends on the input at time  ii  and the output at previous times  i−1i−1,  i−2i−2, ...:

There's are two example using HMM concept.

-   **Language model**:  p(wi|wi−2,wi−1)p(wi|wi−2,wi−1)
-   **Hidden Markov model**:  p(yi|wi,yi−1,yi−2,…)p(yi|wi,yi−1,yi−2,…)
    -   e.g.,  yiyi  is part-of-speech tag at time  i
