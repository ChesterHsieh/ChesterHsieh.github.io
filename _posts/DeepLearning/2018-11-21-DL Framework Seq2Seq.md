# Introduction
This post is series of Tensorflow exploring. It's personal study note. I assume reader should have basic idea about how deep learning works. 
## Tensorflow Basics
### Tensor rank
scaler => 0 rank
image = > 2 rank
text => 
### Data type
### Graph 
build the computational graph. 
It's unlikely general function work. 
- build graph
- build session
- run
### 

# Embedded
#### embedding_lookup

# LSTMCell


# Some nn 




# Key knowledge
 - stepwise_cross_entropy
 - AdamOptimizer
