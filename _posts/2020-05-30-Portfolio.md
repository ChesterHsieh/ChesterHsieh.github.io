# Gold
Currency != Money, that's all idea come from. 
There are few assumption make here:

1. Money supply is increasing
2. Stock will go low in the crisis
3. Gold supply/Demand stay stable.



## Money Supply 
<iframe src='https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/embed/?s=unitedstamonsupm0&v=202005091008V20191105&d1=19950611&h=300&w=600' height='300' width='600'  frameborder='0' scrolling='no'></iframe><br />source: <a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m0'>tradingeconomics.com</a>

This graph shows the m0 supply in past 25 years. 2008, 2013,2020 are three different turning  points, and they represent 3 Great recession. Following question is where the currency goes? 

## Stock will go low- Do we hit the bottom?
[Did the Stock Market Bottom?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW_iwk5e5y4&t=789s) explains well about the moment. 
- The stock market follows economic activities
- During the past recession, the stock market crashed ~ 50%
- It took few hundred days for the stock market to go from peak to the bottom

Here's the extra factors at this time, Covid-19. Even in the best case, it still need to take years to distribute vaccine to most relevant countires, which include some poor countries.

## Gold supply and demend.
The last factor is inevitable to be discussed. Even we believe the 2 assumptions above, any goods/real estate can be the option. For example, oil is something necessary for most industrial, but price is going to crash in Feburary. 

Because the demand and supply play essential role in price.

Oil supply isn't something stable, the amount of supply increses steadly over years.

 [Gold demend and supply](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/gold-supply-and-demand-statistics) is comparatively stable in every aspects. 


## Sum up
Let's talk if we agree the assumptions. We should know the currency need to find the exit, the real estate/money/stock is the primary ways for inflation.

**Still has some questions:**
- No doubt, the gold is shiny and attractive, however, it doesn't have huge amout of  requirements for the varieties of industry. Who or when the gold was becoming "moeny"? 
- There's somewhere else for the money goes.  I must investigate real estate price during past recessions. If the price going up, the real estate ETF can be another part of portfolio.

 

# Terminology Section
- **P/B**
asset - liability = owner's equity
- **debt v.s. cash**
It's very bitter this moment. ARLP, which is one stock of my portfolio ,has terrible number on the index. 25 cash versus 800 debt.  Nonetheless, debt isn't good indicator, at least isn't good single number to outline the company. 67Debt ignore the long/short term time relationship.
