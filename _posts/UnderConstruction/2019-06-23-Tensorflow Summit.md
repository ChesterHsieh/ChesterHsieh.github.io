# Some feature already exist
The freature in tensorflow eco-system
- tensorboard
- tensorflow model analysis
- Tensorflow Hub
# Some speed unit
1.13 exaFLOPs


# Deployment
- Tensorflow serving
- Tensorflow lite
- Tensorflow .js
- Binding for other languages

# Training workflow
tf.data -> keras+premade estimator -> Eager Execution + autograph + Distributed Stratagy + tensorboard -> Saving model

## tf.distributed.MirrowedStrategy
## Tensorflow HUB
Provide the pre-traind model for future purpose. It's like github but tf model version.

## tf.function
in eager execution mode, it should be like a label to show the function block for eager execution mode.

# Javascript
**Why is so important to announce this ?**
JS is the dynamic language, it strongly support the front end design. It turn to give another question. How does it connect to DS or backend? 

# Swift support
swift as another option for developing API.
