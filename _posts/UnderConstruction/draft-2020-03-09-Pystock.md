You can also render sequence diagrams like this:

```sequence
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
```

And flow charts like this:



```mermaid  
sequenceDiagram  
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?  
Bob-->>John: How about you John?  
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!  
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!  
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long  
long time, so long  
that the text does  
not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...  
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?  
```
