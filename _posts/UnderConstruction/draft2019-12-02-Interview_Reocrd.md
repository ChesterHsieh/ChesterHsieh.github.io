# Job Description Key point
## Track business needs
PM experience
**那是我身為pm的故事.** One of the core function for the position is try to understand what's the client's requirement.  Following my experience, the client usually don't know what's the real issue. My job is to know the background and solve the problem in limited resource. Here's the story. Our client ask us to build the gym tracker, they're asking to monitor very detail. Not just count the repetition on each exercises but speed, tension time or more. In the limited computing power, our smart band can't handle it. I realize the client is equipment provider. Instead of putting the device on user, we can put it on the weight plate. Successful to remove the individual difference and cost down. 

Always know where's the limitation and not give up to find the compromise. That's the key


##  DS experience v.s. JD

## insight synthesis and presentation
- APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT()
- ORDER BY
- STICK to some 
## Dashboard
1. Airport experience. 
2. Production on NLP
## Condense complex concept
## Cross the deadlines
When I worked in one of our client, we're dealing with very large date set.  The job can only running on cloud cluster and take more than 12 hours to run. 

In technique, we should fail early in for some test. Randomly to pick the some part of sample set. It need to be big enough to test the machine. And some signal should be implement in the beginning.  No matter how the work is urgent, write the test is necessary in anyway.

# Ameralla-Algorithm Engineer Interview
## Plan & Initial idea
It's a little bit wired to see the recruiter invite me on indeed. it has been a year not updating on indeed profile. That's extremely important progression on this year.

Skill requirement
-   hands-on experience in deep learning and its applications to computer vision (e.g. object detection and tracking, semantic segmentation).
- Tensorflow or Pytorch
- C/C++, CUDA
  **Get code review on C++**
- porting computer vision algorithms to embedded systems
    **I have porting experience on turn matlab code into C. It's the time-series data and filter. Unlike the **
- Experience in research of convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, or reinforcement learning is a strong plus.
	**My only research is utilize those on social media data. It will be hard for me to get points on this item.**

# Verizon-Data science
## Question
- Spacy function?
## Failure
- Poor explain on previous job
- Word embedding
- Boost faimly
- Flask wrapper problem.

## Question
3 sum + 2 d
## Failure
- Reinforcment lenaring keep up 
- Pytorch implment, hidden layer number rule of thum
- y = e^x activation function, why not?
- Accuracy loss function
- Story. Should be implmented more.
## Plan
- rebuild profile

- Attention in Bert: **self-attention allows each word in the sentence to look at other words to better know which word contribute for the current word.**
- Attention :The Attention mechanism in Deep Learning is based off this concept of directing your focus, and it pays greater attention to certain factors when processing the data.

## Time-Series Data focasting
- stationary: **Stationarity** is an important characteristic of time series. A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties do not change over time
- seasonality: **Seasonality** refers to periodic fluctuations. For example, electricity consumption is high during the day and low during night, or online sales increase during Christmas before slowing down again.
- autocorrelated :**autocorrelation** is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them.

## Question
- nn with feature importance:
	- PERMUTATION IMPORTANCE: After training model, we shuffle one feature and see how it affect overall perfomance. We can show chage of pecertange of loss function/metric.
	- **Granger causality test**
