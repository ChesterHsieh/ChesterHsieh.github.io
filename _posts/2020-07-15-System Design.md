# Build A Knowledge graph!
Two resources are limited: 
1. Time
2. Storage
 
Therefore, any question will surround this two:
How to reduce time?
How to scale up


------
Question Type:
- How many input? 10B/s
- Where is data come from? logs
- Lantacy? 100ms in 99%
- VM spec?  4cpu 16g ram , 20gb shared memory


--------
Top-Down
1.  Draw a big box that represents the system.
2.  Zoom-in and break that big box into 5â€“6 components.
3.  Briefly discuss the role of each component e.g. compute, storage, front-end, back-end, caching,  queueing, networking, load-balancing, etc.
-----

Then, it will go deeper into 1 or 2 component
 1. Provide multiple solutions
 2. Evaluate them for pros/coo
