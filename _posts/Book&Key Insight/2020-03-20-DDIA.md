## Reliability  

It's a topic about failures and faults.  
- function is correct  
- making mistake  
- loading/volume can handle the required  
fault ~= failure  
fault relies on error handling  
Hardware faults-> Redundancy. AWS is fairly common to fail without message..... SW fault-tolerance is more critical in this situation  

## Scalability  
- Define the Load. => Twitter Example  
- Post tweet: 4.6k requests/sec avg, 12k requests/sec peak  
- Home timeline: view posts they followe 300k requests/sec  
1) Direct to read the database  
2) Design a system can utilize the writting time(post tweet) to reduce the reading time(Home timeline update).  
A hybrid solution in CH 12  
- Performance  
- Latency: the internal perspective of delay. Latency is the duration to handle that request.  
- response time: it's user-view on the suspension. It includes queueing delay/network delay/...etc. Therefore, we tend to think of **response time** as distribution instead of a single reliable number.  
  

scaling up = vertical scaling  
scaling out = horizontal scaling  
  

## Maintainability  

- Operability
	- monitoring health of the system
	- Tracking the problem
	- up to date

Keep the routine task easy. Save the productivity on high-value task. 
	- visibility
	- CI/CD
	- **Provide good default behavior** ( This should be followed in all kind of design)
- Simplicity
	To avoid following:
	- inconsistent naming/terminology
	- tangled dependencies
	- coupling of modules
	- accidential complexity: To achieve this , ***abstration*** is the way to create a easy understand case. Hide details of implementation
- Evolvability
# CH 2 Data Models
This topic discuss about how to design appropriate database for the application.

- RDBMS
- NO sql
	It's very tricky naming. Nosql isn't a unique technology. Anything isn't belong to RDMBS is Nosql.
- Grpah-Like Data models

## Design categories 
- One to Many
	Nested JSON format. Once you query unique ID and pull out all the related information. It's easy for this user case.
- Many to One
	Remove redundant data/option.  It's not natural to document model(Nosql)
- Many to Many
	Books& Authors. One writer might have multiple work, so do the books. 

## RDBMS v.s. Document database
- Schema Flexibility
- Queue type
- Data Locality: how to ETL single data

## Declarative v.s. imperative


## Questions
1. Why many2many relation type query doesn't work well on document database ?
2.

## Storage!
**2 BIG family of database design**
- log-structure = append-only
- Page-oriented = 
### BITCASK
- store ***whole*** hash map in ram
- Update index whenever the new data being stored in DB.

-> New issue: Out of memory hash map
LSM tree/ SStable
### SSTable/LSMtree
***Sorted string table***: Keys are stroed as string. Once we store the key by its key sequence. Boom! the SSTable come out as solution. 
- We are able to merge any size segments in efficient way. The idea behind this scenario is **merge sort**
- No longer need to store whole key-value index. Even the key which we are interested in doen't apper in out record, the neibor keys can provide the samll enough interval. 

  
**H**owever following problem is that we need to remake our writing process.  
Create Btree/LSMtree in memory. Once the data structure over some threshold, write the whole tree into a disk, sequential writing definitely.


## Transcation/Analytics- What's different requirement beind this?

> A transaction needn’t necessarily have ACID (atomicity, consis‐ tency,
> isolation, and durability) properties.

OLTP v.s OLAP

|  Property| Transaction processing systems (OLTP) |Analytic systems (OLAP)|
|--|--|--|
|  Main read pattern| Small number of records per query, fetched by key |Aggregate over large number of records|
|Main write pattern|Random-access, low-latency writes from user input|Bulk import (ETL) or event stream|
|
