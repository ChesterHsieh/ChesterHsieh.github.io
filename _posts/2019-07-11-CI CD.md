# CI/CD Hello world
Keep the code quality need both concept and tool. CI/CD too l
To anwer this 
# CI 
基本上需要,
## unit test, TDD
CI core. Heavy test + limited testing before coding.
要求你不要寫過多功能的Code. 限制住功能的Scope. 每一個function 必須有相當.
- Test 必須一定要先錯. 才能是有意義Test
- 
## CI server
Don't need people testing CI. That's solution to solve the style. 
***Ref: PEP8***
- To guarantee the code style staying the same
- Unit-test pass!
- Fully automatic
**travis ci** is almost best tool for staring our CI/CD hello world. 


# CD
Continuous delivery. 自動佈署. 
自動發佈到server  上面的工具. 
## Docker
Docker is very mature and convenient tool. Only necessary part will be introduced in this section.
### Docker init
### Docker customized
[Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is docker version github. Easy to share and easy to advanced them is the trend for now. We can also find tensorflow provide its hub  also.

# To understand Scum master
scum is principle to on building giant software. 必須要有周期作demo. 沒有浪費功能在不適用
Agile 保持應變能力, 追求逐步疊代. 檢討周期內部.

Scum 
- Product owner=>負責產品成敗. Create user story.
- 主持會議. 確保scum 推行
- Push and maintain Agile
# stakeholder
利益關係人. Product owner, Developer, Boss 都是

# 系統架構
-流量進來 3x, 5x 流量 balanced
- Low balanced 分流, 吃  c10k problem 
## Database 如何存取資料
## Web server, response, job queue

# 
## Software component 安排
Class, 繼承, interface. Abstract class( 安排程式碼的未來可能性). Module 間作Communication. 擴充難易度(limited modification for new features)

clean architecture

# The book I need to read
Hardworking and Keep reading are indivisible. The difficult part is to decide which book deserve we take our precious time to invest on.

1. Clean Code
2. Clean architecture
