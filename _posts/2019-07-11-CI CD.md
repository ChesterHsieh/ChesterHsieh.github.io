# Increasing productivity! 
To keep the work done quick and efficiency is like doing sport. There are ton of the technique, strategy, footwork... and **muscle**.  After few calls from different position all over the whole software technology, I realize I have no idea how to improve code quality and reduce the developing time. CI/CD, clean code are two basic idea can help me on this. Hope this article can help those who want to try and seek for **hello world** case. Although this project doesn't provide clean hello world case, it's still good practice reference. 

## What project is?
This project is to build a easy tool helping people make easier choice on buying beef. Fat quantity and distribution is fundamental


# CI 
基本上需要,
## unit test, TDD
CI core. Heavy test + limited testing before coding.
要求你不要寫過多功能的Code. 限制住功能的Scope. 每一個function 必須有相當.
- Test 必須一定要先錯. 才能是有意義Test
- 
## CI server
Don't need people testing CI. That's solution to solve the style. 
***Ref: PEP8***
- To guarantee the code style staying the same
- Unit-test pass!
- Fully automatic
**travis ci** is almost best tool for staring our CI/CD hello world. 

# CD
Continuous delivery. 自動佈署. 
自動發佈到server  上面的工具. 

# build
Python 不用真正的build code. 在轉移程式. 

# Docker customized
[Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is docker version github. Easy to share and easy to advanced them is the trend for now. We can also find tensorflow provide its hub  also.


# Auto-reload
1. front-end
	Java-script + web app
	MVP
2. Mockup
    what tool? sketch, illustrator, figma...
