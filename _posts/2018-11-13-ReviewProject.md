## Idea?
THis is poject we developed on **Online Social media Analysis**. 
In the begining idea is very easy. My friend Tina want to know which makeup product is most popular right now. 

However, we realize we need to define what is **popular**? And there's another question following: Is the number of review mean better?

Ok! 

Let's dive into review

## Data collection

## There's too many review
## There's only few review

E-Commence is becoming more and more popular,
the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows
rapidly. Popular products can get hundreds or even thousands
reviews, however, some special products get none reviews if they
are not launched on e-commerce. This makes it difficult for a
potential customer to choose them. Therefore, we proposed the
method which can help customers to find their preferred product
more efficiently.In this paper, we present Makeup Reviews
Engine, a real-time product review analysis system that performs
a review time series plot for Sephora and Twitter and predicted
rating based on Twitter reviews. We also summarize aspects
of product reviews. We evaluate the accuracy of the system
through RMSE (root-mean-square error) and the approach in
the experiment. The result shows that predicted rating on Twitter
is really closed to Sephora product rating. It also successfully
extracts product summary from product review.
