# Plan & Initial idea
It's a little bit wired to see the recruiter invite me on indeed. it has been a year not updating on indeed profile. That's extremely important progression on this year.

Skill requirement
-   hands-on experience in deep learning and its applications to computer vision (e.g. object detection and tracking, semantic segmentation).
- Tensorflow or Pytorch
- C/C++, CUDA
- porting computer vision algorithms to embedded systems
    **I have porting experience on turn matlab code into C. It's the time-series data and filter. Unlike the **
- Experience in research of convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, or reinforcement learning is a strong plus.
	**My only research is utilize those on social media data. It will be hard for me to get points on this item.**
