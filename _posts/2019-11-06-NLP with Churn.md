# Define the problem
Customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service. 

All the telecom/cable/tv services need to know what happen. 
**Why** the customer leave?
**When** they gonna leave? 
**How** they change their mind? Explicitly “retention-first” care strategy or marketing strategy to hedge against their risk of leaving.

If the service is subscription type business. For example e-commerce. Customer don't need to pay periodically. Another question comes out.
