Q1 If java doesn't implement reusing code of being interface, how about the python?

**Seperate those stable and frequent modified parts**



Q&A extract from book:
Q1: Do we need to refactor the code, since we need to know what part of function tend to change all the time?
A1: (Quote from book): Not always; often when you are designing an application,
you anticipate those areas that are going to vary and then go ahead
and build the flexibility to deal with it into your code. Youâ€™ll find
that the principles and patterns can be applied at any stage of the
development lifecycle.
