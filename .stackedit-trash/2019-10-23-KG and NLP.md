表設計就是schema
Scheme design include defining the relation(edge mining) Like subclass, type, .
**SPARQL**
子圖匹配-> NP hard problem
## OWL
*Why we need owl?*
Ontology Language, That's pre-defined relation. Limit the complexity and increasing usable.
OWL is extend for RDF scheme.
OWL represent relation:
Example:
owl:oneOf
owl:unionOf

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| git status | List all new or modified files |
| git diff | Show file differences that haven't been staged |

## SPARQL


# KG embedding
- **RESCAL** tensor decomposition
- **NTN** based on neural network(auto-encoding?)
- **TransE3** based on distance

# KBQA
# Knowledge inference
## Corpus inference
accourding to text to inference. Extract information by frequency
## Representation Learning
## Knowledge Fusion
Different instance in different data set. We can identify they are the same. Similar structure -> same group. **Dedupe**/**LIMES**
# Knowledge Acquire
## D2R
## Graph mapping
## semi-structured data(wikipeidia)
wrappper maintain.
